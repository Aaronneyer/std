## std

A Clojure utility toolkit. There are many like it, but this one is ours.

[![Clojars Project](http://clojars.org/io.framed/std/latest-version.svg)](http://clojars.org/io.framed/overseer)

![Build Status](https://circleci.com/gh/framed-data/std.svg?style=shield&circle-token=bc1973d1d555fa51c8e96c42919837a64836225b)

The library is broadly organized into the following categories:

- `core` - Generically useful helpers to complement `clojure.core`

- `io` - IO utilities to complement `clojure.java.io`

- `serialization` - Unified functions for reading/writing all sorts of structured
  data (CSV, JSON, Nippy, Fressian, and more) to disk

- `time` - Date/time utilities on top of JodaTime (clj-time)

- `math` - Basic math utilities

See the [documentation](https://framed-data.github.io/std) for the gory details.
