## std

A Clojure utility toolkit. There are many like it, but this one is mine.

The library is broadly organized into the following categories:

- `core` - Generically useful helpers to complement `clojure.core`

- `io` - IO utilities to complement `clojure.java.io`

- `serialization` - Unified functions for reading/writing all sorts of structured
  data (CSV, JSON, Nippy, Fressian, and more) to disk

- `time` - Date/time utilities on top of JodaTime (clj-time)

- `math` - Basic math utilities
